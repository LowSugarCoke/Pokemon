 * Description: This header file defines the MainController class which is responsible for handling main
 *              user interactions in the Pokemon game. It interfaces with the game's UI and the PokemonService.
 *              The class contains methods for setting up various callback functions for battle refresh,
 *              test cases, music play etc. It also contains methods to handle button click events for test case,
 *              Pokemon, move, game and battle case operations. The 'connection' method establishes connections
 *              between UI signals and MainController slots.
